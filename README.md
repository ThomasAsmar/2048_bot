I read these two papers and found them very interesting.

  http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf
  
They detail a temporal difference learning approach to learning the game 2048.  
My work here heavily relies on these papers, and I would recommend anyone who is reading this
  or has found this project interesting to read them as well.
